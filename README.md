# ESP32-Microprocessor-Project

As a final project for Microprocessor System class, I decided to program a ESP32 to light up an eight-segment LED strip using bluetooth from a mobile device.  
I used the FastLED Library.  The code can run 3 different light shows at the users command using bluetooth.
